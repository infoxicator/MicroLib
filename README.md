# federated-monolith

Using module federation (a la Zack Jackson) and clean architecture principles (a la Uncle Bob), federated monoliths combine the independence and agility of microservices with the integration and deployment simplicity of monoliths

See [federated-monolith-services](https://github.com/tysonrm/federated-monolith-services) for federated modules used by this project.
